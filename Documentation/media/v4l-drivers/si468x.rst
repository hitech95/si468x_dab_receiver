Parameters exposed over debugfs
-------------------------------
SI476x allow user to get multiple characteristics that can be very
useful for EoL testing/RF performance estimation, parameters that have
very little to do with V4L2 subsystem. Such parameters are exposed via
debugfs and can be accessed via regular file I/O operations.

The drivers exposes following files:

* /sys/kernel/debug/<device-name>/acf
  This file contains ACF (Automatically Controlled Features) status
  information. The contents of the file is binary data of the
  following layout:

  .. tabularcolumns:: |p{7ex}|p{12ex}|L|
